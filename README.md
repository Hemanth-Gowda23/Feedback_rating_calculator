# Feedback Rating Calculator

This Java application provides a dynamic feedback rating calculator for online products. It addresses the issue of skewed ratings due to disproportionate negative feedback by incorporating both Customer Effort Score (CES) and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) into the overall rating calculation.

## Features:
- Distinguishes between positive and negative feedback
- Calculates Customer Effort Score (CES)
- Calculates Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
- Computes a weighted overall rating based on feedback type
- Implements input validation for user responses

## How to Use:
1. Run the application
2. Specify if the feedback is positive or negative
3. Rate the ease of experience (CES)
4. Rate overall satisfaction (CSAT)
5. View the calculated overall rating

This project aims to provide a more balanced and accurate representation of product feedback in online markets.
